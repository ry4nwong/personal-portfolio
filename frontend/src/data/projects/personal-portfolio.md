## Overview

This website brings together my software engineering experience, project highlights, and hobbies in a single interactive space. Designed to feel like a live digital resume, it is a way for visitors (you!) to explore what I've built, what I am passionate about, and where I am headed next.

## Initial Motivation

I built this site not just as a showcase of my technical expertise, but as a creative outlet where I can blend personal interest with professional skills. Whether it's a past internship or side project, it lives here in one cohesive place.

## Features

- **Featured Projects**: Writeups of my technical work with context, challenges, and outcomes
- **Experience Timeline**: A visual breakdown of my professional journey
- **Built With**: `Next.js` and `Tailwind CSS`
