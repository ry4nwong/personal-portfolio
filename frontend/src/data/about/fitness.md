Personal fitness and sports have always been a core part of my life. I grew up playing a lot of baseball, but it wasn't until COVID hit that I found a passion for weightlifting. Since then, lifting and running have become my passion; they help me stay focused and disciplined, both physically and mentally.

**My Lifts:**

- Squat: 375lbs
- Bench: 275lbs
- Deadlift: 535lbs
