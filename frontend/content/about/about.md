Hi, I’m **Ryan**—thanks for stopping by my page! I’m a Computer Science graduate from UC San Diego with a background in full-stack development, backend systems, and AI-driven projects. I’ve interned at [Intuit](/experience/intuit) and [Sephora](/experience/sephora), where I worked on real-world applications used by millions, and I’ve also built [personal projects](/projects) that reflect my interests—like an AI festival chatbot and a fitness tracker app.

What excites me most is finding creative ways to bridge my hobbies with engineering—turning passion into products and side interests into real tools. This site is where I showcase that journey.

Right now, I’m actively looking for full-time software engineering opportunities where I can keep building, learning, and making an impact on both the product and the team.
