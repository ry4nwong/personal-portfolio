## Overview

I created this [website](https://cantamarautodetailing.godaddysites.com/) during the COVID-19 pandemic to support my auto detailing business. The goal was to give clients a clean, professional way to view my work, learn about services, and reach out for bookings. This was an important asset in expanding my reach locally, especially during the days of the pandemic when digital presence mattered more than ever.

## Initial Motivation

This was my first real web project, and it taught me the fundamentals of frontend development, UI/UX, and designing around a business need. It gave me firsthand experience in using software to support real world services and connect with new or returning clients.

## Features

- **Service Gallery**: Breakdown of my services and before/after photos
- **Contact Form**: Simple form for customers to request details or schedule an appointment
- **Custom Branding**: Logo, color schemes, and site design tailored to the business's identity
