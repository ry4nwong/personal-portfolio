## Overview

Sephoraâ€™s distribution team needed a solution to track inventory across U.S. centers and minimize disruptions during peak periods. I helped design and launch a live dashboard that enabled over 1,500 employees to monitor item status with ease, reduced downtime incidents by improving how inventory updates were processed, and restructured database systems to lower storage costs and speed up queries.

I also worked closely with the business team to align QA needs with development, improving reliability and reducing discrepancies between business and engineering teams.

## Key Contributions

- Successfully launched a real-time inventory tracking dashboard using **Angular** and **Material UI** based on mockups designed with **Figma**, enabling 1,500+ Sephora employees to monitor item status across U.S. distribution centers.
- Reduced API downtime incidents by 40%, leveraging **Spring Boot** microservices to sync item-level state changes with **Redis** and inventory databases, ensuring real-time stock visibility and maximum uptime during peak shipping periods.
- Reduced database storage costs by 18% by optimizing a **MySQL** schema managing over 10,000 item and user records, applying **normalization** techniques and refactoring table relationships to optimize query performance.
- Collaborated closely with the business team to translate QA requirements into technical specifications, developing 30+ **Postman** tests to further ensure API reliability and reduce misalignment between product expectation and behavior.
